# C Threads and Processes

Download the provided zip file to ease code development on a local instance of VSCode.

## [Lab3.zip](../src/)

To open the Project Folder extract folder content, run VSCode, and open the extracted (Lab1) folder directly from VSCode.

To test code make sure you have gcc installed and inside the src folder in your terminal type

```sh
gcc -o ex1 l./ab-3-ex-1.c
```

This will compile the code. Then to test the code execute the program:

```sh
./ex1 100 4
```

I'll later try to add a makeFile if I manage to get some free time... or just open a pull request because I may forget to add one (again!)


Feel free to navigate the content inside the folder to better understand the intended behavior of each exercise.
