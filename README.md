# OS Labs

A collection of OS laboratories during the spring semester of 2023 UPRM. Some of these were done in the `MINIX` *micro-kernel* while others can be compilled in a normal `GNU/Linux` enviroment.

Best if you open this in Obsidian.md or vscode, I recommend Obsidian cuz this is just a mess of Markdown files with a few C files.
